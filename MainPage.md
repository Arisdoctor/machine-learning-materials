# Machine Learning Materials: How to Learn ML from the Mathematical Background to Current Algorithmic Approaches

Hello, I congratulate you! First, if you are here, it means that you want to learn Machine Lerning and this page will help you with this. Second, this page is exactly what you need if you want to have a deep knowledges about this area. Let's get started!

First of all, we need to define what is Machine Learning (ML) and why we need to learn them.
